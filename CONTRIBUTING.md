# KetchupBot Development
This page describes our triaging strategy. For general development notes, read [here](https://github.com/smallketchup82/ketchupbot-updater?tab=readme-ov-file#contributing)

## Triage
We tend to use labels for most of our triaging. This explains how we organize our issues

### Priority
When an issue doesnt have a priority label, consider it to be normal priority: neither low priority, nor high priority, it's something that'd be good to have in the near future. When an issue is marked as high priority, it's generally something that we want to get started on ASAP and get in the next release. When an issue is marked as low priority, it's something that we'd like to see implemented at some point, but that point can be anywhere in the distant future. In general, we prioritize issues that are highly concerning, or provide a much better quality of life in using or developing ketchupbot
